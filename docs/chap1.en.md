# Chap1 About the book 

I'd like write a book about [Python click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/).
I can't find much about this topic in the Internet.What i can find was just a couple of writing, and a book, besides the doc from that project.
So click is a python lib, a lib about command line.

I found command line was cool, and you?

And i should let you know that, when i start writing this book, i did'd know much about click.In fact, i was learning click by writing this book.
According to Feynman's Learning Method,you can learn by tech a kid.I don't know if it work very well, so i'd like to give it a try.
If it does, maybe i will do it a lot by writing more open source book.

By the way, writing an open source book is super easy, it almost cost nothing if you know how to do it.
and i will talk on that topic at Chap8.After reading that, you might write a open source book too.who knows.
