```
very simple and direcly.just import click ,and add this line before your function,@click.command(),that's it.one more example from it's docs ([tutorial](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)) 

```
import click

@click.command()
@click.option('--count', default=1, help='Number of greetings.')
@click.option('--name', prompt='Your name',
              help='The person to greet.')
def hello(count, name):
    """Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times."""
    for x in range(count):
        click.echo(f"Hello {name}!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
